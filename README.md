# oci-malware

This is a client for a malware that we found and reversed engineered that uses ICMP tunneling techniques to evade detection.
The VirusTotal report for this malware can be found here: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e50943d9f361830502dcfdb00971cbee76877aa73665245427d817047523667f/detection

NOTE: This currently doesn't run on Windows as scapy sniffer function doesn't seem to work correctly.
This has been tested on Linux only.
